## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

A couple of things I want to learn more about going forward:

- Flexbox and flexbox use cases. While I was working on this I wasn't sure if it was better to use grid or flexbox to structure the contents of the cards. I ended up sticking with grid for now, but as I continue learning about flexbox, I'll come back and update this if turns out to be a more appropriate solution. 

- Responsive design and media queries. I want to learn more about the best ways to utilize `@media` when creating responsive layouts.
